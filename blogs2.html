    <p>The easiest way I could have written this blog was to put some code and explain what each line does.
         I personally feel though, that understanding the mechanics behind these things is very important. Only then one will be able to fine tune it for individual needs. So the clickbait title got you here,
         now keep reading and ask questions in comments if you have any.</p>
         <p><strong>Why Chunking?</strong></p>

         <p>With the advent of JS frameworks and Single Page Apps(SPAs), 
            more and more code, logic and libraries have moved towards user instead of being rendered on the server.
             This, on one side has improved user experience but on the other side has increased the total KBs/MBs getting downloaded in the browser and thus slowing the first paint. Webpack (or whichever build tool you use) bundles all the JS/CSS files needed by your app to run in one big file. This was done with the belief that small files waste precious HTTP requests (as the browser can only do so many at parallel) and thus has its heart at the right place. However, as explained,
             with time the bundle just gets bigger and bigger.</p>
